# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization Project
Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

# Project Overview
* Cloned data from PhonePe's GitHub repository.
* Fetched the data from cloned JSON files to Pandas DataFrames.
* Stored the data in a MySQL database using PyMySQL.
* Created nine tables in the database:
    * Aggregated Transaction
    * Aggregated Insurance
    * Aggregated User
    * Map User
    * Map Transactions
    * Map Insurance
    * Top Insurance
    * Top Transactions
    * Top User
* Used SQL cursor to fetch data from the database to Pandas DataFrames.
* Created four different tabs in Streamlit:
    * Home
    * Transaction
    * User
    * Queries
# Learning outcomes of this project
* Data extraction and processing: You will learn how to use Clone Github to extract data from a repository and pre-process the data using Python libraries such as Pandas.
* Database management: You will learn how to use a relational database such as MySQL to store data and retrieve it efficiently for analysis and visualization.
* Visualization and dashboard creation: You will learn how to use libraries such as Streamlit and Plotly to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards for data visualization.
* Geo visualization: You will learn how to create and display data on a map using Plotly's built-in geo map functions.
* Dynamic updating: You will learn how to create a dashboard that dynamically updates based on the latest data in a database.
* Project development and deployment: You will learn how to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly solution, from data extraction to dashboard deployment. You will also learn how to   
  test and deploy the solution to ensure it is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
